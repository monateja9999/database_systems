Q1) Build a linear regression equation, to predict MEDV. Include a screenshot that shows the linear equation. How many terms are in the equation, and 'why'? In other words, discuss the resulting equation.

ANS: 

The equation for linear regression has 12 terms, or 11 fields from the dataset that are multiplied by their corresponding coefficients and one number that is needed to determine the MEDV (class) value.

The following is the linear regression equation: 

Linear Regression Model

class =

     -0.1084 * CRIM +
      0.0458 * ZN +
      2.7187 * CHAS=1 +
    -17.376  * NOX +
      3.8016 * RM +
     -1.4927 * DIS +
      0.2996 * RAD +
     -0.0118 * TAX +
     -0.9465 * PTRATIO +
      0.0093 * B +
     -0.5226 * LSTAT +
     36.3411


In linear regression, the relationships are represented by linear predictor functions, whose unknown model parameters are inferred from the data.


The MEDV(class) value depends on the following characteristics: CRIM, ZN, CHAS, NOX, RM, DIS, AD, TAX, PTRATIO, B, LSTAT, and a constant of 36.3411,according to the aforementioned linear regression equation.

Q2) Use KNIME to perform linear regression [on all parameters, not a subset]. You need these nodes: AARF Reader, Linear Regression Learner. Create and connect the nodes, and execute each. What is the linear equation? Include a screenshot.

ANS:

Number of rings = -0.8249 * sex=I + 0.0577 * sex=M + -0.4583 * length + 11.0751 * diameter + 10.7615 * height + 8.9754 * whole _weight +  -19.7869 * shucked _weight + -10.5818 * viscera weight + 8.7418 * shell weight + 3.8946

The above is the linear regression equation generated by the KNIME tool to predict the number of rings based on all the given attributes(columns) in the given data.

**********************************************************************

Q3) Do a linear regression to predict num_rings, from length,diameter,height. Question: what is the equation? Include a screenshot. Note that you need a 'Set Role' node where you would set num_rings to be a "label", before doing the regression (to let the regression node know which attribute to predict, using the other non-label ones). The regression itself would be done using a 'Linear Regression' operator.

ANS: 

Number of rings =  -11.933 * length + 25.766 * diameter + 20.358 * height + 2.836


The equation mentioned above represents the linear regression produced by the RapidMiner Studio tool to forecast the number of rings based on the given data's length, diameter, and height variables (columns).

Q4) Take a screenshot of the entire RStudio IDE that shows the code, console output and the map (sufficiently zoomed in) with the hull and centroid markers visible, for submission.
